# Temperature Regression ML

This is just a small ML project which applies some techniques that I have been learning.

The code is pretty straightforward, I'm using Python to look at some historic weather data and:

1. Provide us with a useful summary of the data.
2. Provide us with visualisation of some aspects of the data to let us dig deeper.
3. Predict apparent temperature vs actual temperature and plot this via linear regresssion.

I'm a complete AI / ML newbie but am having fun exploring it. If you stumble across this repository and have any suggestions then let me know in the issues!

Thanks a ton to Edinburgh School of AI for the great tutorials so far!
